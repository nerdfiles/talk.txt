Simple Speech to Hypermedia System

1. [speech-to-text][speech] and a REST microservice over todo.txt, or to vimwiki 
functions in bash. Then you can do lazy encryption. 
2. Use the HTML5 Media driver for audio and capture record handles on 
   textblocks. Inherit linking schemas from existing doctypes. You could use RSS 
   too. Point being todo.txt and .wiki 
3. files are just text. Infinitely portable. You can just save to git repos and 
   use github/gitlab/bitbucket as your database, if it is strictly personal. Set 
   up folder watchers in bash that check last modified date on project folder with 
   diff of cached folder date, then reset REST service in git post-push. 
4. If you want access rights map RESTful commands to chown statements in bash that 
   update a custom group versus public. They accessthe file if they pass in a 
   cgiparam that you specify is the password. Use bitcore's HD wallet to use private 
   key generation for groups then you could share with 2M people per peer group. Scales. 
5. Now broadcasting on all subnets in the languages.
